# WEB103 Prework - Creatorverse

Submitted by: Joshua Holguin

About this web app:

**Creatorverse** is a small CRUD React app for cataloging YouTube/TikTok creators. It uses **Supabase** (Postgres) for data and **React Router** for navigation. On the home page you‚Äôll see all creators as responsive cards (image, name, description, links). From there you can:

- **View** details (`/creators/:id`) via the ‚ÄúMore Details‚Äù button  
- **Add** a creator (`/creators/new`) with name, URL, description, and optional imageURL  
- **Edit** a creator (`/creators/:id/edit`)  
- **Delete** a creator with a confirmation prompt


Time spent: 12 hours

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add.

- Supabase env + client: Wrong var names/exports ‚Üí fixed with VITE_SUPABASE_URL/ANON_KEY and export default supabase.

- Data not showing: Added useEffect fetch + loading/error/empty UI; passed props from App.jsx.

- List not updating after edits: Re-fetch on mutate or use React Query/SWR (future).

- Routing: Wired ‚ÄúMore Details‚Äù via Link to="/creators/:id"; useParams on detail page.

- Forms & validation: Basic required fields, URL check, inline error messages.

- Images & layout: Prefer hosted URLs/Supabase Storage; object-cover for consistent cards.
